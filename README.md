# Prominence of occurrence accorded to data science and other related terms in Philippine newspapers
In the contemporary era marked by the digital revolution, data science has emerged as a pivotal discipline globally. This study examines the prominence and frequency of data science and its associated terminologies within Philippine newspapers. By analyzing a comprehensive selection of major Philippine dailies over 20 years, we assessed how often and in what context these terms appear. Our findings indicate a steadily increasing trend, reflecting the growing significance and understanding of data science in the country. Notably, the words were most frequently associated with business, technology, and academic news sections. However, there was variability in the depth and accuracy of discussions surrounding these terms. The media's portrayal, in many instances, was foundational, suggesting a burgeoning stage of familiarity with data science concepts among the general populace. This study underscores the role of print media in disseminating and shaping perceptions about emerging technological fields in the Philippines. It offers insights into potential areas for enhanced media literacy and collaboration.
